# ai-challenge
This repo will hold the code for the AI challenge

Because we will need a UI at some point if we go for the UI

We will need something like this

```
/
  |__ api
  |__ ui
```

The API project is the minimum required, so we should focus on that. The UI project could be on react or plain HTML it doesn't matter that much.
